Cancer Type Prediction 
Objectives
The primary objectives of this project include:
1.	Developing a Machine Learning Model: To create a robust tool for predicting whether cancer is benign or malignant based on specific input features.
2.	Application of Probability and Statistics: To demonstrate the practical application of probability and statistical techniques in real-world problems, such as medical diagnosis.
3.	Undersampling for Class Balancing: To handle imbalanced datasets effectively by employing random undersampling techniques.
4.	Feature Analysis: To analyze feature importance in predicting cancer types using machine learning algorithms.
5.	Interactive Tool Creation: To develop a user-friendly, interactive application for medical professionals or researchers using Streamlit.
Scope of the Project
This project aims to assist medical practitioners and researchers in understanding the key factors contributing to the classification of cancer types. The focus includes:
•	Utilizing a dataset of breast cancer records for predictive modeling.
•	Employing Random Forest Classifier, a powerful machine learning algorithm, to achieve high accuracy in predictions.
•	Creating a graphical representation of feature importance to enhance interpretability.
•	Streamlining user interaction by designing a straightforward and intuitive interface.
