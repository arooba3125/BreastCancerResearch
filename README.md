Cancer Type Prediction 
The primary objectives of this project include: 
1. Developing a Machine Learning Model: To create an optimized tool for predicting whether 
cancer is benign or malignant based on specific input features. 
2. Application of Probability and Statistics: To demonstrate real-world applications of probability 
and statistical techniques in medical diagnosis. 
3. Balancing Class Distribution: Implementing SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling 
Technique) along with undersampling to handle imbalanced datasets effectively. 
4. Feature Importance Analysis: Evaluating the significance of different features in predicting 
cancer types. 
5. Interactive Tool Development: Creating an efficient and user-friendly web application using 
Streamlit.
